My journey as a software engineer and technical writer is a blend of expertise and  dedication. I possess diverse skill sets encompassing JavaScript, Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Markdown, Git, and GitHub. I've not only delved into the intricacies of technical writing but also exhibited a profound understanding of user research and information architecture.

I gained open-source community experience at Wagtail, a free and open-source content management system (CMS). I worked with the organizers to adapt onboarding tutorials for new Wagtail users.
